Need to build a command line program with Python that 
 - downloads files over the network, and 
 - store them on the local file system. The program will receive two inputs:

1. The URL of an RSS Feed containing links to the files to be downloaded (a sample is given below)
2. The path to the directory where the downloaded files are going to be stored is

python downloader.py --feed=<RSS-Feed-URL> --output=<PATH-TO-DIRECTORY>

        
Requirements 
- The program has to remember if a file has been downloaded previously. So if the file has been downloaded once, it skips downloading it again.
- If a file has been downloaded partially, it can resume from the point where it left off.
- The program should be able to log its activities in a text file.
- The program should support both HTTP and FTP.
- The program should be designed in a way so that it can be easily extended to support additional protocols
- Bonus points if your program is capable of downloading multiple files in parallel.

Here is a link to the sample RSS Feed: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6160850/downloads.rss
